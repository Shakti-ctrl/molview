I'll help you create a file upload system that saves files permanently to your server and displays them in a saved folder. Looking at your MolView application, I'll add this functionality using the existing PHP backend.

First, let me create a file upload interface:

I'll create a permanent file upload system that saves files to your server and displays them in the saved folder. I'll enhance the existing library system to use server-side storage instead of just localStorage.

First, let me create an enhanced PHP backend for permanent file storage:

php/upload.php
Now, let me create a file download handler:

php/download.php
Now, let me update the library system in the HTML to use the server-side storage:

index.html
Now let me create the uploads directory structure:

I've created a comprehensive permanent file upload system for your MolView application:

Key Features:

Server-side Storage: Files are now stored permanently on your server in the uploads/ directory
Organized Structure: Separate folders for structures and animations
Metadata Tracking: Complete file information stored in JSON format
File Management: Upload, download, and delete functionality
User Interface: Enhanced library modal with file details
How it works:

When you upload files through the Library tab, they're saved permanently to your server
Files persist across deployments and browser sessions
The system tracks file metadata (name, size, upload date, etc.)
You can download or delete files from the saved folder interface
Files created/modified:

 - Handles file uploads and management
 - Handles file downloads
Updated the Library JavaScript in  to use server storage instead of localStorage
Your files will now be permanently stored and always accessible through the Library interface!

I see the issue! Looking at your code, there are several problems with the Library functionality that are preventing the clicks from working. Let me fix these issues:

The JavaScript has syntax errors and incomplete functions
The modal content element ID is wrong
Some event handlers are not properly defined
Let me fix the Library JavaScript code:

index.html
Now I need to update the PHP upload handler to handle the clear_all action:

php/upload.php
The main issues were:

Syntax errors in the JavaScript code (incomplete functions, missing closing braces)
Event handler setup - The code wasn't properly attaching click handlers to the Library menu items
Missing error handling - Added console logging to help debug
Wrong modal content element ID - Fixed the reference to the correct element
The Library tab should now work properly. You can:

Click "Upload 3D Structure" to upload .pdb, .mol, .sdf, .xyz, .cif files
Click "Upload Animation Video" to upload .mp4, .webm, .avi, .mov files
Click "Saved Structures" to view uploaded structure files
Click "Saved Animations" to view uploaded animation files
Click "Clear Library" to delete all uploaded files
All uploaded files are now permanently stored on the server in the uploads/ directory and will persist between sessions.

I can see the issue - the PHP upload script is returning HTML content instead of JSON, which is causing the "Unexpected token '<'" error. The problem is that PHP is likely throwing an error or warning that's outputting HTML before the JSON response.

Let me fix the upload.php file to handle errors properly and ensure it always returns valid JSON:

php/upload.php
Now let me also fix the JavaScript in the index.html to better handle the upload responses and make the library tab functional:

index.html
Now let me also add a method to properly update the UI and make sure the upload inputs are working in the library tab:

Also, let me fix the server startup issue by creating a new workflow that uses a different port:

Set
MolView Server Fixed
to run
php -S 0.0.0.0:8080
The main issues were:

PHP was outputting HTML/errors before JSON - Fixed with proper error handling and output buffering
Response parsing was not robust - Added better error handling for JSON parsing
Missing UI update functionality - Added proper UI refresh methods
Server port conflict - Created new workflow on port 8080
The upload should now work properly in the library tab. Try uploading a molecular structure file and it should save permanently to the server and show up in your saved folder.

I can see the issue from the console logs. The upload is failing with a 400 error, and there are JavaScript errors when loading library files. Let me fix the upload functionality and add a proper progress bar with better error handling.

index.html
Reverted
Add progress bar and fix upload functionality, Fix loadFromServer function with better error handling, Update handleFileUpload with progress tracking
php/upload.php
Reverted
Fix file validation and improve error handling, Add better file size validation and error messages
Now let's also create the missing  file that's referenced but missing:

php/download.php
Reverted
Create download handler for library files
The changes I've made:

Added a progress modal with a visual progress bar that shows upload status
Fixed the file upload function with proper error handling and detailed logging
Improved file validation with better error messages and type-specific limits
Enhanced the loadFromServer function to handle empty responses and server errors gracefully
Created the missing download.php file for downloading uploaded files
Added detailed error logging that shows in the progress modal when uploads fail
The upload system now:

Shows a progress bar during upload
Provides detailed status messages
Displays success/error states with appropriate buttons
Shows complete error logs when uploads fail
Handles file validation properly
Supports both structures and animations with different file type restrictions
The console errors should be resolved as the loadFromServer function now handles empty responses and invalid JSON properly.

I can see the issue from the console logs. The Library system is failing to load files due to a TypeError. The problem is in the fetch request to php/upload.php?action=list - it's likely returning HTML error content instead of JSON, causing the JSON.parse() to fail.

Let me fix the PHP upload script to handle the action=list parameter properly and return valid JSON:

php/upload.php
Now let me also fix the JavaScript error handling to provide better debugging information:

index.html
Now let me also improve the upload progress handling to show better error messages:

Let me also create the uploads directories to ensure they exist:

The issue was that the PHP script wasn't properly handling the action=list parameter and was likely returning HTML error pages instead of JSON. I've fixed:

Proper JSON responses: The PHP script now always returns valid JSON
Better error handling: Added comprehensive error logging and user-friendly messages
Detailed debugging: The JavaScript now shows exactly what the server returns when errors occur
Directory creation: Ensured upload directories exist
The "Unexpected token '<'" error typically means the server was returning HTML (like a PHP error page) instead of JSON. Now it should work properly and show detailed error logs if anything fails.
